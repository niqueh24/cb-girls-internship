  </td><td> Hello! I’m Christine Ho, a rising junior at the Gwinnett School of Mathematics, Science, and Technology. At CareerBuilder,
    I have been working with the UX team as an intern. It’s great to see passionate people at work. I have had the opportunity to be exposed
    to many different educational backgrounds, which have given me the chance to learn about pursuable career paths, and majors that I didn’t know about prior to this summer internship.
    This internship has allowed to me to understand important concepts about joining the workforce including networking, branding, communicating effectively, etc. As part of my time here at CareerBuilder,
    I have been involved in various fields such as analytics, web programming, interactive design, and research. Being a CB intern has given me the best hands on experience to help me learn all about Women in
    Tech and understand the best approach to take when joining the workforce.</td></tr>

      They want to see you succeed and they’ll be there to help you along the way.It seems like there’s never a dull moment here,
      there’s always something to learn. At the start of this summer I set out to learn how to code and this internship really helped me reach my goal.
      My team leader was very supportive of this and helped me learn a language called Ruby.With this I was able to make my own website!I’m glad I
      had the opportunity to have an internship here.If you get this opportunity too, don’t hesitate to take it, you won’t regret it!</td></tr>

  </td><td>Ever since being at this internship, I've learned that the people and the environment at CB is super chill and laid-back.
    People from my team (consumer intel) and many other teams have a meeting on Tues​day of every week where all the "squads" present what
    they've accomplished for the week. I've been to one of these meetings and was surprised at how much people can do in a week. My current
    project is meeting up with people and having one-on-one sessions with them about what they do at CB, how they got there, and how they
    ultimately contribute to the company, and I have met up with people from all over the company (examples being UX designers, user
    researchers, software engineers), so I have a little taste of everything. I realized that everyone specializes in their own part and
    do drastically different types of work, but everyone seems to be extremely passionate in what they do.</td></tr>

  </td><td>While interning at CareerBuilder.com, I was on the sales productivity team. I never really considered sales or business as an actual
    career for myself. Therefore, I was definitely branching out and exploring a different field that I could consider in the future. As a
    intern, I mainly help the sales team by cleaning up accounts in the system. I also got to shadow people from different teams so I kind
    of got an overall perspective of how the teams work with each other as a whole. I even attended a few meeting with my sales team and
    saw ideas being discussed and conflicts being solved in a professional manner. I also attended my first ever hackaton! During hackaton,
    I watched people present their final products. Following hackaton, I attended a class led by Tech Talent South and learned some computer
    languages like html, css, and ruby. Overall, my experience at CareerBuilder.com has been phenomenal and the atmosphere that CareerBuilder.com
    has built is incredibly fun to work with.</td></tr>

    </div>

  </td><td> My experience at CareerBuilder has been amazing. On the first day, I learned I was placed on the CBOne Team which is lead by Kyle Bumpus, and
    I also got to meet my mentor, Monica Skidmore. Through the past two weeks, I have learned about Ruby on Rails and HTML & CSS through the
    tutorials on codeacademy. These programs will be essential for my project, which is to create a web application to manage the failed
    applications queue, so I am able to edit, view, categorize, and resend failed job applications in a clean web interphase. I have enjoyed
    working here because it is not only fun, but the work environment is also wonderful because of the disciplined freedom that is given here.
    Overall, this experience has given me insight on what it's like to work in the computer science field, and I am so happy I got this great
    experience.</td></tr>

    </div>

  </td><td>Throughout my time here at Careerbuilder, I have learned numerous things about the UX team (designers specifically) and what they do.
    During my first week, my team leader, Liz Lara, had me work on a teardown of one of my favorite web apps, Polyvore. Initially, I
    loved the web app, but after carefully studying the onboarding process of the site, I realized it was highly flawed. After, I used
    my teardown to do a complete redesign of the homepage. Since then, my team and I have been discussing plans for my last few weeks at
    CareerBuilder. Though not final, we have been considering doing a branding of Axiom Cloud. I have enjoyed this internship very much.
    I love the relaxed environment, the passion I see each employee display, and pride within the company. This experience has been truly
    enlightening.</td></tr>

    </td><td>My experience at CareerBuilder has been life changing! I have been exposed to so many different
      things. Personally, I have been working with the finance team. I have done extensive research on how the group actually functions.
      In about my third week, I was transferred to a team created within the team. I have been working with Joyride. Joyride is basically
      popup boxes that explain changes to a website. For example, if Facebook were to change the setup on the home page, they would have pop
      ups to explain exactly what was changed. For my project I have worked with a mixture of HTML and Ruby to change the descriptions of the
      joyride in axiom cloud. In addition to working on my project, I have been able to learn some basic coding. Prior to this experience I have
      had no knowledge of coding. Now that I am reaching the end of this internship, I am strongly considering a minor in computer science!

     </td>
            <td>I have had such a wonderful experience working at CareerBuilder. I have learned so much. One of my
     biggest surprises was how willing people are to help you. One time I needed help with making a hover drop down menu in CSS. Anyone I
     asked was more than willing to help me and if they did not know how to do it they directed me to someone who could. Everyone always
     says that if you have a question just to ask however I didn’t truly believe it until I had that experience. I work on the Rapid Response
     team. They basically make quick fixers to bugs on the site so that the developers don’t always have to back track and fix what they did
     in the past, but they can move on and create new products. I am working on getting product owners the information from the feedback that
     is often submitted to the Rapid Response team.

  </td><td> I’m an intern for the Site Technology and in in Brian Hare’s team. My mentor, Allison Fabella has given me
    so much helpful advice about school and the technology field. Through her and others’ guidance, I’ve become interested in startups, and I
    would like to do something like that during or after college.For my project, I modified a local site using Ruby on Rails to display graphs
    (and an Hispanic Bunny) on the TV Dashboard. Throughout the internship, I learned basic web design and software like Git and Rubymine.
    It has also exposed me to a broader view of the technology field. After my project, I will continue working with the team and learn
    more about web development

  </td><td> These five weeks at Careerbuilder have been life changing. In this short amout of time I have learned
    so much from my mentor, host team, speakers, and other CareerBuilder employees. My goal before the internship began, was to learn more
    coding languages. During my time here I have learned SCSS Ruby and Ruby On Rails.My final project is to used what i learned and create a website
    using Ruby on rails about each interns eperience here.It has been difficult but I managed to make my way through.My eyes have been opened up
    to how useful technology is and how it has changed lives for the better. I am a rising senior and this experience has help guide my
    decisions for the future.
